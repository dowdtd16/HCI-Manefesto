## Design Manefesto for Trevor Dowd

Over the course of the term, I have realized that there are many aspects of design that I had not previously thought of. All of these aspects are very important to consider because neglecting one will make the whole project look significantly worse. 

### Time Crunch
Time was one of the biggest enemies for most of the projects this term.  In almost all of the projects, my team and I would have lots of ideas, but we would not have time to implment them.  Because of this, it was very important to understand how much we would be able to do and make changes to our orginal idea based on this. The last project was a great example of this.

My team and I intially intended to implement many different games for our circus.  Because none of us had experience with a-frame, we had know idea of how difficult it would be to implment the different games.  We quickly figured out that it would be very difficult to implement more than one game because of how much time we had to work on the project.  We quickly changed our idea to only include the duck game.  Because of this, we were able to implement the duck game and make it look better than if we tried to implement multiple games.  By understanding that our orginal idea was too complex, we were able to pivot and we ended up with a simple, but clean looking carnival for our users to enjoy.
It is important to make sure that your ideas can be realisticly implemented throughout the design process.  If you try to implement to many things, you will be left with a design that looks half complete.
